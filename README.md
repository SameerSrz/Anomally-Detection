Anomaly Detection: Real-Time Detection of Weapons and Fire
This project focuses on developing a real-time anomaly detection system capable of identifying potentially hazardous situations involving weapons or fire. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system aims to enhance security and safety in various environments by detecting and alerting users to threats in real time.

Project Overview
Objective: To detect weapons and fire using a robust anomaly detection model.
Scope: Ideal for implementation in security-sensitive environments such as public spaces, private properties, and corporate settings.
Technology Stack: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Deep Learning (CNNs), and Flask (for deployment).
Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Monitors video feeds to instantly recognize weapons and fire, providing quick alerts to security personnel.
Computer Vision & Deep Learning: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models for accurate object detection.
Flexible Deployment: Designed to work across different environments and devices.
Alert System Integration: Triggers real-time alerts when a weapon or fire is detected.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SameerSrz/Anomally-Detection.git
cd anomaly-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Pre-trained Models: Download pre-trained models for weapons and fire detection. These models should be placed in the models/ directory (details on obtaining the models are in the models folder README).

Usage
Run the Detection Script:
bash
Copy code
python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4
Replace path/to/video.mp4 with your input video file, or use a live video stream by specifying your camera device.
Output: The script displays video with real-time annotations on detected anomalies.
Model Training
If you want to train the model from scratch:

Prepare the Dataset:
Organize images of weapons, fire, and non-threatening objects in labeled directories.
Training the Model:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir path/to/dataset
Configure hyperparameters and model layers in train.py.
Deployment
To deploy this anomaly detection system as a web application:

Run Django Server:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application:
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to view the interface and upload video feeds.
Results
Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in detecting weapons and fire (based on testing dataset).
Latency: Designed to perform in real time with minimal delay, suitable for live video feeds.
Future Work
Expand Anomaly Types: Add detection for additional hazards like smoke or suspicious movements.
Enhance Model Accuracy: Fine-tune models with larger datasets for improved accuracy.
Integrate Audio Alerts: Implement audio alert options for immediate notification.
